This project manages the suites of free resources offered by Crane Softwrights Ltd. for public consumption in the case of disaster (or full retirement!) of the corporate website.

This site can be browsed directly at https://CraneSoftwrights.github.io/ but until the company is shut down the preferred route to our free resources is from the [http://CraneSoftwrights.com/](http://CraneSoftwrights.com/links/githubio.htm) corporate website.
