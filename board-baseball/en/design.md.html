         1.1 Initiating new SVG work after releasing to QA for testing
      </h3>
      
      <p>The process of a release creates a number of burn and print
         files in the <a href="https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/board-baseball/blob/main/burn"><code>../burn</code></a>
         subdirectories that reflect the content of the design SVG file.
      </p>
      
      <p>Thus, as soon as the SVG file is touched, the burn files no
         longer are guaranteed to reflect what is in the SVG.
      </p>
      
      <p>When starting new work after a snapshot has been moved to QA for
         testing, be sure to delete all files except the
         <code>README.md</code> file in the <a href="https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/board-baseball/blob/main/burn/svg"><code>../burn/svg</code> directory</a> and the
         <a href="https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/board-baseball/blob/main/burn/pdf"><code>../burn/pdf</code> directory</a>. This
         way anyone visiting the site will find files only in the QA branch
         and main branch.
      </p>
      
      <p>Also, the version number in the SVG file needs to be changed
         early in two different layers (one for print and one for burn) so
         there is no confusion regarding the SVG file not reflecting the
         published files. See the “Update the version string” subsection
         below for details.

         physical levels
      </h3>
      
      <p>The <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> application
         helps to manage layers of content. The “Layers and Objects” panel
         reveals:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>layers of print and burn detail content, organized semantically
            regarding content and use
         </li>
         
         <li>singleton layers used in their own context</li>
         
         <li>empty layers representing content levels
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>the title of the combined level dictates the combination of
                  other layers
               </li>
               
               <li>see discussion below regarding assembling design and content
                  layers
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         
         <li>layers of scratch-pad work</li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The typical format of the way a detail layer is labeled is:
         <code>L#:B#</code> representing:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li><code>L#</code>{level of the physical
            board}<code>:B#</code>{burn index for the level}
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>supplemental layer for the level</li>
               
               <li>layer 1 has the main objects layer for the given level</li>
               
               <li>layer 2 has the outside cuts and the alignment holes</li>
               
               <li>layer 3 has the peg holes</li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The actual components of the label before and after are
         arbitrary and can be in any format. As described below regarding
         assembly, labels are collected by the label prefix; the label
         suffix is used only for distinction.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="fonts">2. Fonts</h2>
      
      <p>These design files use the “Noto Serif” and “Noto Sans”
         available for free from the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto"><code>https://fonts.google.com/noto</code></a>
         site. The compressed and extra-compressed font variants are used
         predominantly.
      </p>
      
      <p>As part of the production process, all text in the review copy
         of the design file is converted to paths and so there is no need
         for the PDF reading tool attached to the cutting machine to have
         these fonts pre-loaded.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="cuts">3. Cuts</h2>
      
      <p>It is assumed that in the PDF file sent to the laser cutter, a
         stroke with a stroke width of .001in is a “cut” instruction to
         device. Otherwise, the surface of the material is etched. No
         consideration for colour is made in the etching.
      </p>
      
      <p>For design management purposes, all SVG strokes with magenta
         #ff00ffff stroke paint, regardless of stroke width, are interpreted
         in the production process as needing to be converted to have a
         stroke width of .001in. During design these strokes are drawn with
         a stroke width of 1.5mm assuming that to be the (generous) width of
         the laser kerf.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="release-notes">4. Release notes</h2>
      
      <p>These are the steps undertaken to make a final release suitable
         for checking into QA for testing. They are documented to help the
         developers remember to do everything, since there are many steps
         that need to be followed.
      </p>
      
      <p>Remember to save frequently as Inkscape appears to crash easily
         when working with layers.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="update-the-version-string">4.1 Update the version
         string
      </h3>
      
      <p>Update the version strings (two), one for print and the other
         for burning.
      </p>
      
      <p>Look in the “Layers and Objects” panel for the two layers with
         “+ version” in the layer name. Un-hide the layer but leave the
         layer locked. Open up the nested groups until you find the text
         string labeled “Version”. Select it and press “3” to zoom in on the
         string. Press “T” to enter text mode and make the change. Press
         “Esc” to get out of editing the string. Hide the layer again.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="assembling-design-layers-into-combined-levels">4.2
         Assembling design layers into combined levels
      </h3>
      
      <p>Assembling design layers into combined levels is accomplished by
         naming conventions used in the layer titles in the SVG. These
         combining layers should be empty because they are replaced in their
         entirety during the production process.
      </p>
      
      <p>Individual design layers include labels as described above for
         levels but can be any pattern of
         <code>{label}:{distinction}</code>.
      </p>
      
      <p>A combined layer’s title directs the assembly of all of the
         layers in the order needed. The beginning of the title is the
         assembly name, followed by an equal sign “=” (separated with
         spaces), followed by as many <code>{label}:*</code> indications, in
         order and separated by spaces, of the collections of SVG layers to
         assemble. Consider this example:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li><code>L1-crop-9x12 = CropMarks9x12:* Crop9x12:* L1:*</code>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>pull in three sets of SVG layers, in order, into a single
                  assembly
               </li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>In turn, collages also are empty layers that use the same
         conventions in the layer title to pull in assemblies:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li><code>13-9x24-collage = L1-crop-9x12:* L3-crop-9x12:*
               Tiling-9x24:*</code></li>
         
      </ul>
      
      <p>The actual assembly is accomplished in the production steps by
         XSLT stylesheets that read the design SVG XML and output a review
         SVG XML of all assemblies. This process is very quick and so it
         makes sense to use it to create the assemblies for review.
      </p>
      
      <p>The review SVG file is then burst into individual SVG files, one
         for each collage and print assembly. The collage and print SVG
         files need some manual intervention before converting the SVG files
         to PDF using the synthesized batch script. The resulting PDF files
         need some manual intervention to orient them as desired for the
         laser cutter, as well as a one-last-time review of their accuracy
         before use.
