      <h3>Help information</h3>
      
      <p>
         Use this to create initial skeleton instances of an <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.2.html">OASIS UBL 2.2
            document</a> created by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl">OASIS UBL technical
            committee</a>.
         The end result will not be schema valid because of the
         absence of attribute values and certain required values (such as dates).
         It is expected that the instance displayed will be selected, copied
         and pasted by you into your favourite XML editor.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         This will not read existing instances.  This is only for prototyping
         the overall initial structure of a document.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>
         The hyperlinked question marks will open another browser window and load
         all of the model information into that window from the OASIS web site.
         Once loaded, navigation in that window will be quite quick.  A suggested
         mode of operation is to have both windows open and visible at the same
         time so that each time you click on the question mark the other window
         updates with the complete model information.
         
      </p>

         <b>Credit:</b> This tool is based on the Saxon-CE (Client Edition)
         browser-based XSLT 2.0 processor found at <a href="http://saxon.sf.net" target="_blank"><samp>http://saxon.sf.net</samp></a>.
         This powerful tool runs a conforming XSLT 2.0 processor in the browser
         as compiled JavaScript (hence the performance basis on the speed of your
         browser).

      <h3>Important notes:</h3>
      <pre>
    <small>This program works entirely within the user's browser.  At no time is any
information sent back to the server.  Accessing the page loads the HTML,
loads the Saxon-CE processor, loads the stylesheet and loads the model
information.  Once loaded and the user begins interaction, there is no
access to the server.

Because of this browser-based approach, your performance is limited to the
performance of your JavaScript engine in your browser and the speed of the
data connection in order to download the large file of model information.
AS A RESULT THIS APPLICATION RUNS MORE SLOWLY THAN SERVER BASED PROGRAMS!
Please do not expect the results to be shown quickly, but once shown, it is
intended to be very useful information.  We welcome suggestions for new
features but we will keep in mind the restricted nature of the environment.
