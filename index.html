   <p>
     If that doesn't work or doesn't interest you and you are back to this page,
     then one of three things has happened:
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li>
     (likely) you are here browsing from the
     <a href="https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/CraneSoftwrights.github.io"
     ><samp>https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/CraneSoftwrights.github.io</samp></a>
     GitHub repository 
   </li>
   <li>
      (possible) there is a temporary glitch reaching
      <a href="http://www.CraneSoftwrights.com/links/githubio.htm"
      ><samp>http://CraneSoftwrights.com</samp></a> and you found this
      page instead; please try again later
   </li>
   <li>
      (inevitable in a disaster scenario) the Crane website is no longer
      up and running due to full retirement of its entire staff
      and/or a complete shutdown of the company and the web site
   </li>
   </ul>
  <p>
    As part of our disaster planning, we have made all of our free resources
    available on GitHub for the community to use:
